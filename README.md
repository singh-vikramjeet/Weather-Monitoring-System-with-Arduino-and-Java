Current Tasks:
Java Fx 11 does not work on Mac OS, switched to Java Fx 16 on both Windows and Mac OS.
Test the layouts and the UI controls in the Oracle Java Fx docs.
Current Goals in the Major Project
1. To get temperature data through DHT11 and Arduino from the Countdown Handler
and display it on the JavaFx label.
2. To get temperature data from the OpenWeather API and
display it on the Java Fx label.
3. If parts 1 and 2 are successfully completed do some research on
the layout/display of Java Fx
4. Find out how you can add CSS stylesheet.
5. Figure out if you can use the barometer sensor on Grove board in similiar way
6. To add additional functionality, you can consider using the TableView
from Lab I Part 3 and make a datalogger.
7. See if you can make use of Matix keypad or Serial LCD in this Major Project.
8. Use DataController class from Lab I instead of CountdownHandler class for fetching temperature data from the Arduino.
